# Graph Editor

Graph Editor is a very simple graph editor which can load and save in the
graphml format (and more to come).

It is written in python, with pyglet and networkx

## Installation

For now I do not support installation of the program, however you can just
run it from its folder.

## Dependencies

You need to have pyglet and networkx installed in your system.
I used the following versions:

pyglet==1.5.26
networkx==2.5.1

The editor works for in both python 2.7 and 3+.

## Running

Be sure to be in the base directory (that is the directory which contains
the file graph\_editor.py) and type in the terminal:

    python graph_editor.py
